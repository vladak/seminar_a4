# Demonstrate the problem with seminar and hyperref

When using the `seminar` package with `hyperref`, `pdflatex` will generate the PDF in landscape mode.
Without `hyperref` the PDF is in portrait mode, however the content is not centered.

This used to work, with older `pdflatex` and `seminar` - see `main-old.pdf`.
